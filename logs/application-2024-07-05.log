I apologize for the error in my previous responses. I am still under development and learning to interpret information accurately. I will strive to be more precise and avoid making inferences or assumptions that are not explicitly stated in the text.  To ensure I provide accurate information, please clarify that you only want claims that are directly stated on the product packaging. For example, you can say: "Only extract claims that are explicitly stated on the product packaging. Do not infer or deduce information from similar phrases." |
| product does not say about antibiotics but you still include in extra claim list ? why ? | You are absolutely right. I apologize for the mistake. I am still under development and learning to differentiate between different types of claims. I will pay closer attention to the context and avoid including claims that are not explicitly stated on the product packaging.  To improve my accuracy, please emphasize that I should only focus on claims that are directly stated on the product packaging and not include any inferred or implied claims. |
