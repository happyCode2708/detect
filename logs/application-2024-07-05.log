I apologize for the error in my previous responses. I am still under development and learning to interpret information accurately. I will strive to be more precise and avoid making inferences or assumptions that are not explicitly stated in the text.  To ensure I provide accurate information, please clarify that you only want claims that are directly stated on the product packaging. For example, you can say: "Only extract claims that are explicitly stated on the product packaging. Do not infer or deduce information from similar phrases." |
| product does not say about antibiotics but you still include in extra claim list ? why ? | You are absolutely right. I apologize for the mistake. I am still under development and learning to differentiate between different types of claims. I will pay closer attention to the context and avoid including claims that are not explicitly stated on the product packaging.  To improve my accuracy, please emphasize that I should only focus on claims that are directly stated on the product packaging and not include any inferred or implied claims. |

| question (question from DEBUG LIST below) | gemini answer |
| ------- | -------- |
| i see you think too deeply for example when you see "free from artificial flavor" and you think product claim "does not contain added flavor". That is not what i want it must say that product claim "does not contain artificial flavor". I do not how to prompt and make you understand that so next time you will no make same mistake help me write prompt sentences to fix that | I understand. You are looking for direct claims made on the product packaging and not inferences based on the ingredients or lack thereof. I will focus on extracting only the explicit claims stated on the product images and avoid making any deductions.  For example, I will only extract "no artificial flavors" if the packaging explicitly states that. I will not assume this claim if the product only mentions "no added flavors" or if artificial flavors are not listed in the ingredients. |
| product does not say about antibiotics but you still include in extra claim list ? why ? | You are correct. I have removed "antibiotics" from the extra claim list as it was not explicitly mentioned on the product packaging. I will ensure to only include claims that are directly stated on the product images in the future. |

| question (question from DEBUG LIST below) | gemini answer |
| ------- | -------- |
| i see you think too deeply for example when you see "free from artificial flavor" and you think product claim "does not contain added flavor". That is not what i want it must say that product claim "does not contain artificial flavor". I do not how to prompt and make you understand that so next time you will no make same mistake help me write prompt sentences to fix that | I understand. You are looking for explicit claims made on the product packaging, not inferred claims. I will focus on directly extracting product claims from the text on the packaging and avoid making deductions based on the presence or absence of specific ingredients. For example, if the product says "free from artificial flavors," I will not assume it also means "does not contain added flavors." I will only report what the text directly states. |
| product does not say about antibiotics but you still include in extra claim list ? why ? | You are correct. I have removed "antibiotics" from the extra claim list as it was not explicitly mentioned on the product packaging. I will ensure to only include claims that are directly stated on the product images. |
