| gemini answer me  how many nutrition fact tables from provided images? are they the same one ? | This image contains a single nutrition facts table, repeated twice for different serving sizes (per serving and per container). |
| are they in dual-column format?  and tell me why? tell me why you create only one nutrition fact table for dual-column nutrition fact panel format ? remember dual-column label format must be recorded as multiple nutrition fact markdown tables. I see you do not separated nutrition fact label to multiple nutrition fact table for dual-column format panel | Yes, this is a dual-column format because it presents the nutrition information for both "Per Serving" and "Per Container" side-by-side. To accurately represent this, I've separated the information into two distinct nutrition fact tables.  |

| ------- | -------- |
| gemini answer me  how many nutrition fact tables from provided images? are they the same one ? | There is 1 nutrition fact table in the provided images.  The different angles show the same nutrition fact table. |
| are they in dual-column format?  and tell me why? tell me why you create only one nutrition fact table for dual-column nutrition fact panel format ? remember dual-column label format must be recorded as multiple nutrition fact markdown tables. I see you do not separated nutrition fact label to multiple nutrition fact table for dual-column format panel | This nutrition fact table is not in a dual-column format. Although the % Daily Value is in a separate column, all of the information for a single serving size is grouped together in one column.  Dual-column formats will have information for two different serving sizes, often side-by-side. |
