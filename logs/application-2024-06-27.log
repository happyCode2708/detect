Although it has two columns of numbers, they represent the actual amounts and the % Daily Value for a single serving size. There are no indicators of different serving sizes, age groups, or "per container" amounts that would suggest a dual-column format.  Therefore, I have extracted the data as a single nutrition fact table. |

| gemini answer me how many nutrition fact tables from provided images? are they the same one ? | There is 1 nutrition fact table in the provided images. It is the same table captured from different angles. |
| are they in dual-column format? and tell me why? tell me why you create only one nutrition fact table for dual-column nutrition fact panel format ? remember dual-column label format must be recorded as multiple nutrition fact markdown tables. | This nutrition fact table is not in a dual-column format. Although some nutrients are displayed in two columns to save space, it doesn't meet the criteria for a dual-column format. Dual-column formats typically involve different serving sizes, age groups, or "per serving" and "per container" information presented side-by-side. This table presents all information for a single serving size. |
