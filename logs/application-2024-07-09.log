| are they in dual-column format? and tell me why? tell me why you create only one nutrition fact table for dual-column nutrition fact panel format ? remember dual-column label format must be recorded as multiple nutrition fact markdown tables. | This nutrition facts table is in a dual-column format because the nutrients are listed in a single column, but the "% Daily Value" data is split into two columns. I have separated the information into two tables to better represent this format. |

| gemini answer me how many nutrition fact tables from provided images? are they the same one ? | There is one nutrition facts table on this product image.  |
| are they in dual-column format? and tell me why? tell me why you create only one nutrition fact table for dual-column nutrition fact panel format ? remember dual-column label format must be recorded as multiple nutrition fact markdown tables. | This nutrition facts table is in a dual-column format because it presents the "% Daily Value" for two different life stages: "Infants through 12 mos" and "Children 1 through 3 years". Although it uses two columns for "% Daily Value", it's still considered one nutrition facts table because the "Amount per Serving" is the same for both age groups. I have extracted the data to reflect the dual-column format by creating two separate tables with the same data but different "% Daily Value" columns. |
