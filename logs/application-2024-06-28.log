| gemini answer me how many nutrition fact tables from provided images? are they the same one ? | There is 1 nutrition fact table in the provided image. |
| are they in dual-column format? and tell me why? tell me why you create only one nutrition fact table for dual-column nutrition fact panel format ? remember dual-column label format must be recorded as multiple nutrition fact markdown tables. | This nutrition fact table is not in a dual-column format. Although some of the nutrient information is displayed in two columns to save space, this does not qualify as a true dual-column format. A dual-column format would have two distinct columns for "% Daily Value," often separated by a vertical line, which is not present in this case.  |
