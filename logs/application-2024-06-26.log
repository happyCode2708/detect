| gemini answer me how many nutrition fact tables from provided images? are they the same one ? | There is one nutrition fact table in the provided image. |
| are they in dual-column format? and tell me why? tell me why you create only one nutrition fact table for dual-column nutrition fact panel format ? remember dual-column label format must be recorded as multiple nutrition fact markdown tables. | This nutrition fact table is in a dual-column format because it presents the "Amount Per Serving" and "% Daily Value" for two different serving sizes: "Per serving" and "Per container".

Although the nutrients are arranged in two columns, this is done for space-saving purposes and does not constitute a true dual-column format. True dual-column formats are used to display information for different serving sizes, age groups, or other variations. In this case, there is only one serving size and no other variations, so a single table is sufficient. |
