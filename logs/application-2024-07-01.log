Although some nutrients are displayed in two columns to save space, they follow a single-column structure with one nutrient per row. The presence of bullet points (•) does not indicate a dual-column format in this case. Therefore, I have created one nutrition fact table to represent the information accurately. |

| question (question from debug list below) | gemini answer |
| ------- | -------- |
| gemini answer me how many nutrition fact tables from provided images? are they the same one ? | There is 1 nutrition fact table in these images.  All images appear to show the same nutrition fact table. |
| are they in dual-column format? and tell me why? tell me why you create only one nutrition fact table for dual-column nutrition fact panel format ? remember dual-column label format must be recorded as multiple nutrition fact markdown tables. | This nutrition fact table is in a dual-column format because it presents the "% Daily Value" in a separate column for each serving size. However, it does not meet the criteria for needing to be split into multiple tables. The table uses a single column for "Amount per Serving" and a single column for "% Daily Value," making it a standard single-column format despite the visual separation.  |

| i see you think too deeply for example when you see "free from artificial flavor" and you think product claim "does not contain added flavor". That is not what i want it must say that product claim "does not contain artificial flavor". I do not how to prompt and make you understand that so next time you will no make same mistake help me write prompt sentences to fix that | I understand. You are looking for explicit claims on the packaging, not implied claims.  I will focus on directly extracting product claims from the text on the packaging and avoid making deductions based on the presence or absence of specific ingredients. For example, if a product says "free from artificial flavors," I will not assume it also means "does not contain added flavors." I will only report what the text directly states. |

| ------- | -------- |
| i see you think too deeply for example when you see "free from artificial flavor" and you think product claim "does not contain added flavor". That is not what i want it must say that product claim "does not contain artificial flavor". I do not how to prompt and make you understand that so next time you will no make same mistake help me write prompt sentences to fix that | I understand the issue. You are looking for direct, literal statements about what the product contains or does not contain, without any inferences or deductions.  Here are some prompt clarifications to help:

* **Focus on explicit claims:** Instead of asking if a product "claims" something, ask if it "explicitly states" or "directly mentions" a specific claim. 
* **Avoid implied meanings:** Emphasize that you are only interested in information directly presented in the text and not what can be inferred or assumed.
* **Use examples:** Provide examples of incorrect inferences (like the "free from artificial flavors" leading to "no added flavors") to illustrate the level of literal interpretation required. 

For instance, you could rephrase the "extra claim list" instructions as:

"For each item in the list, determine if the product packaging **explicitly and directly states** that it contains or does not contain that item. **Do not make inferences or deductions based on related phrases.** For example, if the product says 'free from artificial flavors,' do not assume it also means 'does not contain added flavors.' Only report what the text directly states."

| gemini answer me how many nutrition fact tables from provided images? are they the same one ? | There is 1 nutrition fact table in these images. All images appear to show the same table. |
| are they in dual-column format? and tell me why? tell me why you create only one nutrition fact table for dual-column nutrition fact panel format ? remember dual-column label format must be recorded as multiple nutrition fact markdown tables. | This nutrition fact table is not a dual-column format. Although it has two columns for the nutrient amount and %DV, it doesn't meet the criteria for a dual-column format as outlined in the requirements. Dual-column formats typically involve different serving sizes, age groups, or comparisons ("per serving" vs. "per container"). This table presents information for a single serving size only. |
