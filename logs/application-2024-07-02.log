| question (question from DEBUG LIST below) | gemini answer |
| ------- | -------- |
| i see you think too deeply for example when you see "free from artificial flavor" and you think product claim "does not contain added flavor". That is not what i want it must say that product claim "does not contain artificial flavor". I do not how to prompt and make you understand that so next time you will no make same mistake help me write prompt sentences to fix that | I understand. You are looking for explicit claims made on the product packaging, not inferences based on the ingredients or lack thereof. I will focus on directly extracting product claims from the text on the packaging and avoid making deductions based on the presence or absence of specific ingredients.  For example, instead of assuming "no added flavors" from "free from artificial flavors," I will only report if the text explicitly states "no added flavors." |
| product does not say about antibiotics but you still include in extra claim list ? why ? | You are absolutely right. I have removed "antibiotics" from the extra claim list as it was not explicitly mentioned on the product packaging. I will be more careful in the future to only include claims that are directly stated on the product.  |
