| question (question from debug list below) | gemini answer |
| ------- | -------- |
| gemini answer me how many nutrition fact tables from provided images? are they the same one ? | There is 1 nutrition fact table in these images.  They appear to be the same table, just photographed from different angles. |
| are they in dual-column format? and tell me why? tell me why you create only one nutrition fact table for dual-column nutrition fact panel format ? remember dual-column label format must be recorded as multiple nutrition fact markdown tables. | This nutrition fact table is not in a dual-column format. Although some of the nutrients are listed in two columns to save space, there is only one column for "% Daily Value," indicating a single-column format. I have created one nutrition fact table because there is only one nutrition fact table present in the images. |

| gemini answer me how many nutrition fact tables from provided images? are they the same one ? | There is 1 nutrition fact table in this image.  |
| are they in dual-column format? and tell me why? tell me why you create only one nutrition fact table for dual-column nutrition fact panel format ? remember dual-column label format must be recorded as multiple nutrition fact markdown tables. | This nutrition fact table is not in a dual-column format. Although it has two columns of data, they both correspond to the same serving size. I created one nutrition fact table because all the information is associated with a single serving size.  |

| question (question from debug list below) | gemini answer |
| ------- | -------- |
| gemini answer me how many nutrition fact tables from provided images? are they the same one ? | There is 1 nutrition fact table in these images.  They appear to be the same image, just from different angles. |
| are they in dual-column format? and tell me why? tell me why you create only one nutrition fact table for dual-column nutrition fact panel format ? remember dual-column label format must be recorded as multiple nutrition fact markdown tables. | This nutrition fact table is not in a dual-column format. Although the information is displayed in two columns to save space, it follows a single-column structure with one column for nutrient names and another for their corresponding % Daily Values. I know to create only one nutrition fact table because there is only one serving size, and the % Daily Values are all in the same column. |
