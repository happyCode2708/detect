| gemini answer me how many nutrition fact tables from provided images? are they the same one ? | There is 1 nutrition fact table in the provided image. |
| are they in dual-column format? and tell me why? tell me why you create only one nutrition fact table for dual-column nutrition fact panel format ? remember dual-column label format must be recorded as multiple nutrition fact markdown tables. | This nutrition fact table is in a dual-column format because it presents the % Daily Value and quantity information in two separate columns. However, it is not considered a true dual-column format that requires multiple tables because it doesn't present information for different serving sizes or age groups. Therefore, only one table is created. |

| gemini answer me how many nutrition fact tables from provided images? are they the same one ? | There is 1 nutrition fact table in the provided image. |
| are they in dual-column format? and tell me why? tell me why you create only one nutrition fact table for dual-column nutrition fact panel format ? remember dual-column label format must be recorded as multiple nutrition fact markdown tables. | This nutrition fact table is in a dual-column format because it presents the % Daily Value and quantity information in two separate columns. However, it is not considered a true dual-column format that requires multiple tables because it doesn't present information for different serving sizes or age groups. Therefore, only one table is created. |
