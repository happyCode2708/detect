Carefully examine the image provided and created a neatly formatted JSON output containing a list of objects only if info available on image and Each object should contain:

{
"panelName": string ,
"amountPerServing": {"name": string?},
"calories": {"value": float?, "uom": "calories"}
"servingSize": {"description": string?, "value": string, "uom": string},
"servingPerContainer": {"value": float? or number?, "uom": string},
"nutrients": [{"name": string, "quantityComparisonOperator": string?, "value": float?, "uom": string, "quantityDescription": string?, "dailyPercentComparisonOperator": string?, "percentDailyValue": float,  "footnoteIndicator": string?, }],

Some rules for you:
1) panelName: if there is text on image contain "Nutrition Facts" or "Supplement Facts". If not it should be null

2) Extract exact numbers provided. No calculations or approximations are permitted.

3) Notations like 'Includes 7g of Added Sugars' should be recorded as "name": "Added Sugars", "value": 7, "uom": "g".

4) Each nutritional line's values must stay unique. Do not interchange numbers between lines or make false inferences. For instance, "total sugar 18g, included 5g added sugar 4%," should create two objects: one as "name": "total sugar", "value": 18, "uom": "g", "percentDailyValue": null, and another as "name": "added sugar", "value": 5, "uom": "g", "percentDailyValue": 14%.

5) The fields 'value', 'uom' (unit of measure), and 'percentDailyValue' can be empty or null. The 'value' is a float number, 'uom' is a string with no numeric characters, and 'percentDailyValue' is a float (without the percentage symbol).

6) Be cautious of potential typos and characters that may look similar but mean different (e.g., '8g' may appear as 'Bg', '0mg' as 'Omg').

8) In case of multiple panels in the image, create separate panel objects for each. Attempt to decipher the panel name from the adjacent text. It might be challenging to find it sometimes.

9) If there is only the name of the nutrient and the percentage, then it is considered the 'percentDailyValue', and 'value' and 'uom' are both null.

10) Ingredients usually appear below or next to the nutrition panel and start right after "ingredients:" or "Ingredients:" or "INGREDIENTS:" or "Other Ingredients:". 

11) if you do not detect the value please leave it null

12) Notations like "10 serving per container" should be recorded as "name": "servingPerContainer", "value": 10, "uom": "serving per container"

13) Notations like "Contain" or "May Contain" or "contains: string."  should be recorded as "name": "contain", "value": string. For example: "May contain milk" should be recorded as "name": "contain", "value": "May contain milk". For Example: "Contain: Coconut, Milk." should be recorded as "name": "contain", "value": "Coconut, Milk."

14) The fact panel could be in the "dual-column" layout showing both "per serving" and "per container" information. Let's to break down and separate into two different fact panels one is for 'per serving'
 and other for 'per container' just if "amoutPerServing.name" of them are different. These two fact panels have the same value of "servingPerContainer", "footnote', "ingredients" and "contain".

15) "servingSize" rules:
+ "servingSize" content's first format = value + uom
+ "servingSize" content's second format = description(value + uom)
Ex 1: "10 tablespoons(80g)" should be recorded as "servingSize": {"description": "10 tablespoons", "value": "80", "uom": "g"}
Ex 2: "10 tablespoons" should be recorded as "servingSize": {"value": 10, "uom": "tablespoons"}

15) "amountPerServing.name" rules:
+ is a text and usually stay above the "calories value number",
Ex 1: "Per container", "Per serving"

16) "nutrient.quantityComparisonOperator" rules:
+ "nutrient.quantityComparisonOperator" is a comparion operator at the left side of "nutrient.value".
Ex: 1: "<1g" should be recoreded as "nutrient.quantityComparisonOperator": "<".

17) "nutrient.dailyPercentComparisonOperator" rules:
+ "nutrient.comparisonOperator" is a comparion operator at the left side of "nutrient.percentDailyValue".
Ex: 1: "<1%" should be recoreded as "nutrient.dailyPercentComparisonOperator": "<".

18) "footnote" rules: 
+ "footnote" section is in the bottom part of fact panel (the note may contain some special charactor "*", "+", "**"). 
+ "footnote.footnoteIndicatorList" is a list of special characters found in "footnote.value"
+ "footnote.value" contains all specials symbol from "footnote.footnoteIndicatorList"
Ex 1: "**Percent Value *Based on" should be recorded as  "footnote.value":"**Percent Value *Based on", "footnote.footnoteIndicatorList": ["*", "**"].
Ex 2: "*Daily Value not established." should be recorded as "footnote.value": "*Daily Value not established.", "footnote.footnoteIndicatorList": ["*"]. 
Ex 2: "†Daily Value not established." should be recorded as "footnote.value": "†Daily Value not established.", "footnote.footnoteIndicatorList": ["†"].  

19) "nutrient.footnodeIndicator" rules:
+ "footnote.footnoteIndicatorList" is a list of special character or a group of special characters such as "*", "**", "+"
+ "footnote.footnoteIndicatorList" must contain "nutrient.footnodeIndicator",
Ex 1: "<10%**" should be recorded as "footnote.footnoteIndicatorList": "**"
Ex 2: "***" should be recorded as "footnote.footnoteIndicatorList": "***"

20) "nutrient.name" rules:
Ex 1: "Vitamin K2(as Naturally Derived MK-7 [Menaquinone-7)" should be recorded as "name": Vitamin K2(as Naturally Derived MK-7 [Menaquinone-7)

21) "nutrient.quantityDescription" rules:
+ "nutrient.quantityDescription" is additional text right next to "nutrient.uom" and inside the parentheses, and does not include parentheses.
Ex 1: "20mcg(800 IU)" should be recorded as "nutrient.quantityDescription": "800 IU".
