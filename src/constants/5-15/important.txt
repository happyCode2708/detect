The Most Important rule:
+ Only get data that visibly seen by normal eyes not from other sources on internet
+ Remind again if you see fact panel just give detail data that could be seen by human eyes not from other source like internet.
+ Only get ingredients data that visibly seen by normal eyes not from other sources on internet.
+ Remind you again only provide the data visibly on provided image, and must be detected by human eyes not from other source on internet.

Some common constants:
+ FOOTNOTE_INDICATORS = ["*", "**", "†", "★★", "★"]

Some definitions:
1) about the "Fact Panel"
+ is a list of nutrient or substance info
+ must have a Big Text like a Header such as "Nutrition Facts" or "Supplement Facts" visible on it
+ be careful when you (gemini) confirm to see something since curvature of container or cropped image can make content obscured.

Some common rules:
+ "nutrients" is an array that usually start with some nutrients such as "Total Carbohydrate", "Vitamin A", ... Let's list nutrient from them first if possible.
+ Read "Fact Panel" from left to right and from top to bottom.
+ content in prompt can be similar to typescript and nodejs syntax.
+ be careful the last "nutrient row" could be misread to be a part of "footnote". Remember "footnote" content ususally about "Daily value" or "percent daily value" note.
+ do not return json in format [{product: {...}}] since the result is only for one product

Some rule for you:
1) "product.isFactPanelGoodToRead" = array of answers of all below questions:
+ Carefully inspect the image and answer question Can you see the fact panel? return "yes" or "no" only
+ Can you see "serving size info" from fact panel? return "yes" or "no" only
+ is the exact text "Supplement Facts" or "Nutrition Facts" 100% visible on provided image. Carefully inspect the image and do not assume that text on the image ? return "yes" or "no" only

2) Notations like 'Includes 7g of Added Sugars' should be recorded as "name": "Added Sugars", "value": 7, "uom": "g".

3) The fact panel could be in the "dual-column" layout showing both "per serving" and "per container" information, or different "% Daily value" by age. Let's to break down and separate into two different fact panels one is for 'per serving'
and other for 'per container' just if "amoutPerServing.name" of them are different or "servingSize" of them are different. These two fact panels have the same value of "servingPerContainer", "footnote', "ingredients", and "contain".

4) "product.panelName":
+ if there is text on image contain "Nutrition Facts" or "Supplement Facts". If not it should be null

5) "servingSize":
+ if "servingSize" content contains the parentheses so "servingSize" format = servingSize.description + "("+ servingSize.value + servingSize.uom ")" 
+ else "servingSize" format = servingSize.value + servingSize.uom
Ex 1: "10 tablespoons(80g)" = {servingSize: {"description": "10 tablespoons", "value": "80", "uom": "g"}}
Ex 2: "10 tablespoons" = {servingSize: {"value": 10, "uom": "tablespoons"}}

6) "footnote":
+ "footnote" must be the last part of fact panel (the note may contain some special characters from FOOTNOTE_INDICATORS),
and must be a note contain "Daily Value....", or "Not a significant source...".
+ "footnote" is only one section, and is not multiple sections.
+ "footnote.footnoteIndicatorList" is a list of special characters found in "footnote.value"
+ "footnote.value" contains all specials symbol from "footnote.footnoteIndicatorList"
+ "footnote.footnoteIndicatorList" only contain character from FOOTNOTE_INDICATORS
Ex 1: "**Not a significant source of saturated fat, trans fat. *Daily Value not established. = {footnote: {value :"**Not a significant source of saturated fat, trans fat. *Daily Value not established.", footnoteIndicatorList: ["*", "**"]}}
Ex 2: "*Daily Value not established." = {footnote: {value: "*Daily Value not established.", footnoteIndicatorList": ["*"]}}
Ex 3: "†Daily Value not established." = {footnote: {value: "†Daily Value not established.", footnoteIndicatorList": ["†"]}}
Ex 4: "Not a significant source of saturated fat, trans fat." = {footnote:{value: "Not a significant source of saturated fat, trans fat.", footnoteIndicatorList: null}}

7) "nutrients.footnoteIndicator":
+ "nutrients.footnoteIndicator" is a special symbol such as "*", "†" or is a group of special symbol such as "**" beside the nutrient percent value. Sometimes nutrient percent value is left empty but still have footnoteIndicator right there.

8) "amountPerServing.name":
+ is a text and usually stay above the "calories value number",
Ex 1: "Per container", "Per serving"

9) "nutrient.quantityComparisonOperator" and "nutrient.dailyPercentComparisonOperator" rules:
+ "nutrient.quantityComparisonOperator" is a comparison operator at the left side of "nutrient.value" and "nutrient.uom"
+ "nutrient.dailyPercentComparisonOperator" is a comparison operator at the left side of "nutrient.percentDailyValue".
+ "nutrient.dailyPercentComparisonOperator" is not "nutrient.quantityComparisonOperator".
Ex 1: "10g    <10%" = {quantityComparisonOperator: null, dailyPercentComparisonOperator: "<", ...}
Ex 2: "<10g    10%" = {quantityComparisonOperator: "<", dailyPercentComparisonOperator: null, ...}
Ex 3: "<10g    <10%" ={quantityComparisonOperator: "<", dailyPercentComparisonOperator: "<", ...}

10) "nutrients.quantityDescription":
+ is additional text right next to "nutrient.uom" and inside the parentheses, and does not include parentheses.
Ex 1: "20mcg(800 IU)" = {quantityDescription: "800 IU"}
Ex 2: "20mcg DFE(800mcg L-5-MTHF) = {quantityDescription: "800mcg L-5-MTHF"}


13) "ingredientsGroup.ingredients":
+ usually appear below or next to the nutrition panel and start with a prefix of "ingredients:" or "Ingredients:" or "INGREDIENTS:" or "Other Ingredients:".
+ "ingredientsGroup.ingredients" does not include that prefix
Ex 1: "Ingredients: Flour, Eggs,"= {ingredients: "Flour, Eggs."}

14) "product.productName" rules:
+ extract possible name of product from given image.

15) "product.upc12" rules:

+ upc12 could be easily detected at the bottom of the barcode
Ex 1: "0    33445   44421    5" =  {"upc12": "033445444215"}

16) "product.website" rules:
+ find website link
+ website link exclude "nongmoproject.org"
+ be careful the content after slash could be phone number
Ex 1: text "www.test.com/999.444.3344" should be recorded as {website: "www.test.com", ...} since the number after slash is phone number

+ "product.sizeUom" is "Units of Liquid Measurement" (such as "Fl OZ", "L", ...) or "Weight Units of Measure" (such as "Gram", "Kg", ...)
+ "product.sizeUom" exclude "calories"
Ex 1: "Net 3 Qt. (96 fl. oz.) 2.835L" should be recorded as {"primarySize": 96 , "sizeUom": "fl. oz." , "primarySizeText":  "value": "Net 3 Qt."}
Ex 2: "64 FL OZ(2QTs) 1.89L" should be recorded as {"primarySize": 64 , "sizeUom": "FL OZ" , "primarySizeText": "64 FL OZ"}
Ex 3: "Net WT 5.25 OZ 150g" should be recorded as {"primarySize": 5.25 , "sizeUom": "OZ" , "primarySizeText": "5.25 OZ"}
