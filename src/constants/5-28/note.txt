The product packaging is flat, but the image you provided shows it slightly curved, likely due to the shape of the bag it's printed on.

This curvature can make it slightly harder to read the text, especially if you're trying to read a whole line at once.

Here's why:

Our brains expect straight lines: We're used to reading text printed on flat surfaces, so our brains are wired to process information in straight lines.
Curvature disrupts the flow: When text is curved, our eyes have to constantly adjust to follow the lines, which can be tiring and make it harder to focus.
Can we still read it?

Yes, we can still read the text on a curved surface, but it might require:

More effort: Our brains need to work a bit harder to process the information.
Slower reading: We might need to slow down our reading speed to compensate for the curvature.
Focusing on smaller sections: It might be easier to focus on smaller chunks of text at a time, rather than trying to read a whole line in one go.
