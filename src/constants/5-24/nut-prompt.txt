The Most Important rule:
+ Only get data that visibly seen by normal eyes not from other sources on internet
+ Remind again if you see fact panel just give detail data that could be seen by human eyes not from other source like internet.
+ Only get ingredients data that visibly seen by normal eyes not from other sources on internet.
+ Remind you again only provide the data visibly on provided image, and must be detected by human eyes not from other source on internet.

Some definitions:
1) about the "Fact Panel"
+ is a list of nutrient or substance info
+ must have a Big Text like a Header such as "Nutrition Facts" or "Supplement Facts" visible on it
+ be careful when you (gemini) confirm to see something since curvature of container or cropped image can make content obscured.

Some common rules:
+ "nutrients" is an array that usually start with some nutrients such as "Total Carbohydrate", "Sugar", "Vitamin A", ... Let's list nutrient from them first if possible.
+ each "nutrients" is separated by a thin line on nutrition fact panel.
+ "nutrients" and "footnote" are also separated by a line on nutrition fact panel.
+ Read "Fact Panel" from left to right and from top to bottom.
+ content in prompt can be similar to typescript and nodejs syntax.
+ be careful the last "nutrient row" could be misread to be a part of "footnote". Remember "footnote" content ususally about "Daily value" or "percent daily value" note.
+ do not return json in format [{product: {...}}] since the result is only for one product

Nutrient rule:
1) sometimes nutrients could be put vertically and separated by • symbol and • symbol is not the 'nutrients.footnoteIndicator'

2) some nutrients such as ("Total Carbohydrate", "total sugar", "Includes... Added Sugars", ...) and they are must be separated nutrients

2) Each nutritional line's values must stay unique. Do not interchange numbers between lines or make false inferences. For instance, "total sugar 18g, included 5g added sugar 4%," should create two objects: one as "name": "total sugar", "value": 18, "uom": "g", "percentDailyValue": null, and another as "name": "added sugar", "value": 5, "uom": "g", "percentDailyValue": 14%.

3) Notations like 'Includes 7g of Added Sugars' should be recorded as "name": "Added Sugars", "value": 7, "uom": "g".

4) The nutrition fact panel could be in the "dual-column" layout showing both "per serving" and "per container" information, or different "% Daily value" by age. Let's to break down and separate into two different fact panels one is for 'per serving'
and other for 'per container' just if "amoutPerServing.name" of them are different or "servingSize" of them are different. These two fact panels have the same value of "servingPerContainer", "footnote', "nutrients" but each "nutrients" could have different "footnoteIndicator".

5) "factPanels.panelName":
+ if there is text on image contain "Nutrition Facts" or "Supplement Facts". If not it should be null

6) "nutrients.servingSize":
+ if "nutrients.servingSize" content contains the parentheses so "servingSize" format = servingSize.description + "("+ servingSize.value + servingSize.uom ")" 
+ else "nutrients.servingSize" format = servingSize.value + servingSize.uom
Ex 1: "10 tablespoons(80g)" = {servingSize: {"description": "10 tablespoons", "value": 80, "uom": "g"}}
Ex 2: "10 tablespoons" = {servingSize: {"value": 10, "uom": "tablespoons"}}
Ex 3: "10 bars(200g)" = {servingSize: {"description": "10 bars", "value": 200, "uom": "g"}}

7) "footnote":
+ "footnote" must be the last part of fact panel (the note may contain some special characters from FOOTNOTE_INDICATORS),
and usually start with "%Daily Value....", "Not a significant source...", or "the % daily value...".
+ "footnote" is only one section, and is not multiple sections.
+ "footnote" may contain multiple languages. Please only provide "footnote" in english only. Do not include spanish text on footnote 

Ex 1: "**Not a significant source of saturated fat, trans fat. *Daily Value not established. = {footnote: {value :"**Not a significant source of saturated fat, trans fat. *Daily Value not established."}}
Ex 2: "*Daily Value not established." = {footnote: "*Daily Value not established."}
Ex 3: "†Daily Value not established." = {footnote: "†Daily Value not established."}
Ex 4: "Not a significant source of saturated fat, trans fat." = {footnote: "Not a significant source of saturated fat, trans fat."}

8) "nutrients.footnoteIndicator":
+ "nutrients.footnoteIndicator" is a special symbol such as "*", "†" or is a group of special symbol such as "**" beside the nutrient percent value. Sometimes nutrient percent value is left empty but still have footnoteIndicator right there.

9) "amountPerServing.name":
+ is a text and usually stay above the "calories value number",
Ex 1: "Per container", "Per serving"

10) "nutrient.quantityComparisonOperator" and "nutrient.dailyPercentComparisonOperator" rules:
+ "nutrient.quantityComparisonOperator" is a comparison operator at the left side of "nutrient.value" and "nutrient.uom"
+ "nutrient.dailyPercentComparisonOperator" is a comparison operator at the left side of "nutrient.percentDailyValue".
+ "nutrient.dailyPercentComparisonOperator" is not "nutrient.quantityComparisonOperator".
Ex 1: "10g    <10%" = {quantityComparisonOperator: null, dailyPercentComparisonOperator: "<", ...}
Ex 2: "<10g    10%" = {quantityComparisonOperator: "<", dailyPercentComparisonOperator: null, ...}
Ex 3: "<10g    <10%" ={quantityComparisonOperator: "<", dailyPercentComparisonOperator: "<", ...}

11) "nutrients.quantityDescription":
+ is additional text right next to "nutrient.uom" and inside the parentheses, and does not include parentheses.
Ex 1: "20mcg(800 IU)" = {quantityDescription: "800 IU"}
Ex 2: "20mcg DFE(800mcg L-5-MTHF) = {quantityDescription: "800mcg L-5-MTHF"}

12) "nutrients.descriptor" rules:
+ "nutrients.descriptor" could be the text that is intended and appear on the row below a nutrient.
+ "nutrients.descriptor" could also be the text inside the parentheses right next to "nutrients.name"
+ "nutrients.descriptor" could be the list of ingredients in blend or mix.

13) "nutrients.name" rule:
+ "nutrients.name" is a name of nutrient sometimes include the text closed inside the parentheses.
+ "nutrients.name" sometimes start with a special symbol or its name is bold and maybe a note just like name of an ingredient
Ex 1: "Vitamin K2(as Naturally Derived MK-7 [Menaquinone-7)" should be recorded as {"name": "Vitamin K2", "descriptor": "as Naturally Derived MK-7 [Menaquinone-7": ,...}
Ex 2: "Medium Chain Triglyceride (MCT) Oil" should be recorded as {"name": "Medium Chain Triglyceride (MCT) Oil", ...} 

14) "nutrients.uom" rules:
+ some possible "nutrients.uom" such as "MCG DFE"

15) "amountPerServing.name" rules:
+ is a text and usually stay above the "calories value number".
+ "amountPerServing.name" could be a text below "%Daily Value" Header such as "for children...", or "for aldults..."
Ex 1: "Per container", "Per serving"

16) "nutrients.percentDailyValue"
+ could be null or empty. if its value is empty or null just left it value "null"
+ nutrient "trans fat" do not have "percent daily value" and its "nutrients.percentDailyValue" must be null 
Ex 1: "100g 10%" should be recorded as {"percentDailyValue": "10%", ...}
Ex 2: "100g    " should be recorded as {"percentDailyValue": null, ...}
Ex 2: "1g  <1%" should be recorded as {"percentDailyValue": "1%", ...}
