Some common constants:
+ FOOTNOTE_INDICATORS = ["*", "**", "†", "★★", "★"]

Some definitions:
1) Notations like 'Includes 7g of Added Sugars' should be recorded as "name": "Added Sugars", "value": 7, "uom": "g".

2) about the "Fact Panel"
+ is a list of nutrient or substance info
+ must have a Big Text like a Header such as "Nutrition Facts" or "Supplement Facts" visible on it
+ be careful when you (gemini) confirm to see something since curvature of container or cropped image can make content obscured.

Some common rules:
+ "nutrients" is an array that usually start with some nutrients such as "Total Carbohydrate", "Vitamin A", ... Let's list nutrient from them first if possible.
+ Read "Fact Panel" from left to right and from top to bottom.
+ content in prompt can be similar to typescript and nodejs syntax.
+ be careful the last "nutrient row" could be misread to be a part of "footnote". Remember "footnote" content ususally about "Daily value" or "percent daily value" note.
+ do not return json in format [{product: {...}}] since the result is only for one product

Some rule for you:
1) "product.isFactPanelGoodToRead" = array of answers of all below questions:
+ Carefully inspect the image and answer question Can you see the fact panel? return "yes" or "no" only
+ Can you see "serving size info" from fact panel? return "yes" or "no" only
+ is the exact text "Supplement Facts" or "Nutrition Facts" 100% visible on provided image. Carefully inspect the image and do not assume that text on the image ? return "yes" or "no" only
+ "dietaryIngredients" is completely separated with "nutrients" and "nutrients" does not include "dietaryIngredients" list.

2) The fact panel could be in the "dual-column" layout showing both "per serving" and "per container" information, or different "% Daily value" by age. Let's to break down and separate into two different fact panels one is for 'per serving'
and other for 'per container' just if "amoutPerServing.name" of them are different or "servingSize" of them are different. These two fact panels have the same value of "servingPerContainer", "footnote', "ingredients", "dietaryIngredients" and "contain".

3) "product.panelName":
+ if there is text on image contain "Nutrition Facts" or "Supplement Facts". If not it should be null

4) "servingSize":
+ if "servingSize" content contains the parentheses so "servingSize" format = servingSize.description + "("+ servingSize.value + servingSize.uom ")" 
+ else "servingSize" format = servingSize.value + servingSize.uom
Ex 1: "10 tablespoons(80g)" = {servingSize: {"description": "10 tablespoons", "value": "80", "uom": "g"}}
Ex 2: "10 tablespoons" = {servingSize: {"value": 10, "uom": "tablespoons"}}

5) "footnote":
+ "footnote" must be the last part of fact panel (the note may contain some special characters from FOOTNOTE_INDICATORS),
and must be a note contain "Daily Value....", or "Not a significant source...".
+ "footnote" is only one section, and is not multiple sections.
+ "footnote.footnoteIndicatorList" is a list of special characters found in "footnote.value"
+ "footnote.value" contains all specials symbol from "footnote.footnoteIndicatorList"
+ "footnote.footnoteIndicatorList" only contain character from FOOTNOTE_INDICATORS
Ex 1: "**Not a significant source of saturated fat, trans fat. *Daily Value not established. = {footnote: {value :"**Not a significant source of saturated fat, trans fat. *Daily Value not established.", footnoteIndicatorList: ["*", "**"]}}
Ex 2: "*Daily Value not established." = {footnote: {value: "*Daily Value not established.", footnoteIndicatorList": ["*"]}}
Ex 3: "†Daily Value not established." = {footnote: {value: "†Daily Value not established.", footnoteIndicatorList": ["†"]}}
Ex 4: "Not a significant source of saturated fat, trans fat." = {footnote:{value: "Not a significant source of saturated fat, trans fat.", footnoteIndicatorList: null}}

6) "nutrients.footnoteIndicator":
+ "nutrients.footnoteIndicator" is a special symbol such as "*", "†" or is a group of special symbol such as "**" beside the nutrient percent value. Sometimes nutrient percent value is left empty but still have footnoteIndicator right there.

7) "amountPerServing.name":
+ is a text and usually stay above the "calories value number",
Ex 1: "Per container", "Per serving"

8) "nutrient.quantityComparisonOperator" and "nutrient.dailyPercentComparisonOperator" rules:
+ "nutrient.quantityComparisonOperator" is a comparison operator at the left side of "nutrient.value" and "nutrient.uom"
+ "nutrient.dailyPercentComparisonOperator" is a comparison operator at the left side of "nutrient.percentDailyValue".
+ "nutrient.dailyPercentComparisonOperator" is not "nutrient.quantityComparisonOperator".
Ex 1: "10g    <10%" = {quantityComparisonOperator: null, dailyPercentComparisonOperator: "<", ...}
Ex 2: "<10g    10%" = {quantityComparisonOperator: "<", dailyPercentComparisonOperator: null, ...}
Ex 3: "<10g    <10%" ={quantityComparisonOperator: "<", dailyPercentComparisonOperator: "<", ...}

9) "nutrients.quantityDescription":
+ is additional text right next to "nutrient.uom" and inside the parentheses, and does not include parentheses.
Ex 1: "20mcg(800 IU)" = {quantityDescription: "800 IU"}
Ex 2: "20mcg DFE(800mcg L-5-MTHF) = {quantityDescription: "800mcg L-5-MTHF"}

10) "dietaryIngredients" rules:
+ "dietaryIngredients" is a list of ingredients or a list of ingredient group usually that each "dietaryIngredient" item include "dietaryIngredients.name" and "dietaryIngredients.ingredientDescriptor".
+ and "dietaryIngredients.ingredientDescriptor" usually a text show a list of ingredients that make up an "dietaryIngredient" item.

11) "dietaryIngredients.descriptor" rules:
+ "dietaryIngredients.descriptor" could be the text that is intended and appear on the row below a "dietaryIngredients" item.
